DUP built-in commands

This collection is maintained on the DupInterpreter class. It's copied to
interpreter instances before the interpreter runs, because the â‡’ operator can
destructively modify the built-in commands. This ensures that one program run
can't contaminate subsequent program runs.

The comments use FORTH notation to indicate a function's effects on the stack.
Example: the notation ( a b -- a+b ) indicates the function takes two numbers
a and b off the stack and leaves their sum.

  # While loop
  # ( [condition] [body] -- )
  #
  # This is, by far, the hairiest of the built-in primitives. The main issue is
  # that the "#" operator has to invoke two different lambdas repeatedly, which
  # means it needs to keep track of which of three states it's in:
  # 1) First invocation: invoke the condition lambda.
  # 2) The condition lambda has just been invoked: if condition evaluated to
  #    true, invoke the body lambda, otherwise exit the loop.
  # 3) The body lambda has just been invoked: invoke the condition lambda.
  #
  # For simplicity, we track all this while loop state on the return stack.
  # Each time the "#" operator is executed, it inspects the return stack and
  # reconstructs the state of the loop. If the loop is being hit for the first
  # time, the return stack will have no information. If the condition or body
  # lambdas have already executed at least once, then the return stack will
  # contain:
  # ( [condition] [body] [flag] [marker] )
  #
  # Where flag = 0 if we just executed the condition lambda, or 1 if the body,
  # and marker = the program index of the "#" that put that information on the
  # return stack.
