These Unix-style commands can be run within the DUP terminal.

Since these commands all depend on the window.commands global defined in
commands.coffee, the various command files all indicate their dependency on that
commands.coffee file by including the word "commands" in their file name: e.g.,
"cat.commands.coffee".
