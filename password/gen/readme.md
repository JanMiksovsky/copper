This folder contains experimental code to explore the puzzle space of the
password validation puzzle. Following analysis of its results, it was
determined that puzzles could be quickly generated on the client instead of
needing to be generated at build time. This code is retained in case its
desired that we change the password puzzle and need to reconsider what sorts
of puzzles are possible.
